        We are Fourth year students pursuing a degree in Software and
        Information Systems Engineering (SISE) at Ben Gurion University, Beer
        Sheva.
        <br />We got skills such Managerial abilities, teamwork, interpersonal
        relationships, high work ethic and ability to work under pressure.
        <br />In the last past years we got experience in a lot Systems and
        different frameworks such as: Java, Pyhton, C#, C, C++, SQL and more.
        <br />This year we participated in a web development course and we
        learned new things that are very usefull in the industry like:
        Javascript, Html, Node.Js and Vue. <br />This website is our final
        project in this course and it based on all the things that we have
        learned in web development.

        This project is a food recipes website.
        <br />
        In this website a user can open an account and do many actions such as:
        looking for specific recipe,<br />
        add recipe to his favorites recipes and even watch in last three recipes
        that the user watched.
        <br />In addition a user can watch in random recipes in the home page
        even if he did not register to the system. <br />The system based on
        client-server architecture, the server is develpated in Node.js and the
        client in Vue.<br />
        We used in Azure database to enter personal and family recipes to the db
        and view them in the client side.<br />
        The website is very simple, everyone can use it to learn how to cook new
        recipes and even to call to the project developers to taste and eat.
        <br />
